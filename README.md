# Final-Project

Updated excel files on GitHub with red fighters and blue fighters separated. Then I split the groups into winners and losers. I accidentally deleted the VBA code so when I rewrite it and finish the data set I'll upload it to GitHub. If you needed some working data with Red and Blue winners this will be perfect.

Red losers and blue losers are currently missing from the data set *
