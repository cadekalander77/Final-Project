# Final Project: UFC Prediction Model
## About Our Project
As a group we decided to create a model that will predict the outcome of a given UFC fight, based on the statistics we deem most correlated to the final restult. We selected this topic for the reasoning that we are all fans of mixed martial arts, while at the same time being interested in the determining factors of a fight. We found an all inclusive data set on kaggle.com that provided sigificant statistics of every UFC fight from 1993 to 2021. Our goal with this project is to utilize the data set to determine if a UFC fight can be predicted to a degree based on certain statistics.
