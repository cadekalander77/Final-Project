# Final-Project

I combined all the fighters into one data set with their stats aligned correctly (All_Fighters_aligned) so I could begin machine testing. There are also seperate data sets for Red Fighters, Blue Fighters, as well as another set seperating just winners and losers. There are two sets of Machine learning models that I built to get us started. I used the complete data set to run a decisiosn tree model and a randomforest model. They both performed better than expected. With the randomforest model I was able to generate a list of fields that have the heaviset impact on our predicitons. This will help us pick features that will give us the most improved results. Next step will be to run the same model with our modified data that we chose and then again with the "important" features generated by the machine learning importance report.
